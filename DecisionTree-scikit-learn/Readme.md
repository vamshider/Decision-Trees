# Decision Tree implementation using scikit-learn

* This Decision is built using scikit-learn and graphviz(for visualization)

* The Dataset monks-1.train, monks-1.test, monks-2.train, monks-2.test, monks-3.train and monks-3.test are from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

* The decision tree is learned for the depths 1 to 10 to estimate the average train and test error for different datasets.

Note: Visualisation files are created in your program directory
