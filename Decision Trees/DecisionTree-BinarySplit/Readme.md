* The algorithm uses Entropy and Mutual Information to create the nodes of the Decision Tree.

* Each node is based on an attribute-value pair from the dataset.

* The Dataset monks-1.train and monks-2.train from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

* Include the datasets in a folder **_data_** to run and visualize the decision tree.
