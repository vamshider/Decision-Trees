# Decision Tree using Python

* This Decision tree does not use scikit-learn and is implemented from the scratch.

* The algorithm uses Entropy and Mutual Information to create the nodes of the Decision Tree.

* The tree we learn is a BINARY tree, which means that every node has only two branches. 

* The splitting criterion on each node has to be chosen from among all possible attribute-value pairs.

* The Dataset monks-1.train and monks-1.test from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
